# üêç Python Learning Journey

This repository is my personal journey of learning Python.  
As a Fullstack Developer with experience in Node.js and JavaScript, I decided to start exploring Python to expand my backend skills and work with different technologies.

The goal of this repository is not to be a full Python guide, but rather a collection of my study notes, exercises, and small projects that showcase my progress ‚Äî from basic syntax to building a simple API with **FastAPI**.
